# techTal_jest-testing
class work using jest

## What is jest for?
1. Write tests to describe what is the goal of a function
2. Test the empty function to see (most or all) tests fail
3. Implement the function how it achieves the goal
4. Test the implemented function
5. If any tests fail, interpret the results:
* If the expected value is incorrect, fix the test
* If the received value is incorrect, fix the code
* If both are incorrect, fix both
